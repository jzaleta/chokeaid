Wrap your arms around the waist. Tip the person forward slightly, make a fist with one hand and put it just above the person's navel, grasp the fist with the other hand. Press into the stomach with a quick, upward thrust (as if trying to lift the person up). For a child, use gentle yet firm pressure to avoid damaging the internal organs. Repeat the steps until the person can breathe again or until help arrives.")
